Add a test for price transitivity.
- Add liquidity for one token and give amounts such that the numeraire is in one
token.
- Add liquidity without that token to force a new numeraire, but add equivalent
value. It should get about the same number of shares.
- We'll need to seed the pool pretty significantly first to ensure slippage on
that last n-1 deposit isn't a big deal.
- We can also test this with a lopsided pool and then multiple get price calls.
